### Khayaali Pulao

Khayaali Pulao(Khayaal is a Hindi word for thought, and pulao is a rice dish, but Khayaali pulao is an idiom, ) is a khayaal I had that there isn't a place where people post all their weird ideas, this topic weirdly tries to fit in the feed of twitter, Khayaali Pulao aims to solve this issue, it gives everyone a place to all their weird ideas anonymously, nobody to judge you, get inspired or be an inspiration! If you wish to collaborate on some ideas, drop your email, or social media, to be contacted. The ideas are sorted based on tags. Every Khayaal needs to have 5 tags, so no Khayaal gets lost in the pulao.

It is essentially a social media platform, where anyone can post their 3 AM thoughts, no strings attached.

I wish it was called Biryani.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
